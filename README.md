## 📘 About This Internship Tasks

These projects are part of my Python Programming Internship, where I was assigned multiple hands-on tasks to strengthen my programming fundamentals and practical development skills. Each task focuses on applying core Python concepts such as user input handling, conditional logic, loops, functions, and basic problem-solving. Through these assignments, I am gaining real-world coding experience, improving logical thinking, and building a strong foundation in software development. The tasks are designed to simulate real project workflows and help develop clean coding practices and project structuring skills.
